# MTG_modern_database
This project mostly exists as a way for me to learn about SQL databases. It scrapes the MTGgoldfish commonly played lists for modern and and populates an SQLlite database. It also allows you to to import deck lists into the databases so you can cross refrence your cards against the most popular cards in the format.
